**Data Type:**
* `VT`: Vector Type `Eigen::Matrix<NT, Eigen::Dynamic, 1>`
* `MT`: Matrix Type `Eigen::Matrix<NT, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic>`

## I - Implementation summary & Usage

In this section, I summarize the new implementation to be integrated into `volesti` for sampling correlation matrices.

### **Two new main spectrahedron classes & ReHMC Walks**
I implemented two new classes for representing the spectrahedron $K$ that inherit `volesti`'s `Spectrahedron` class in `include/convex_bodies/correlation_matrices`:  

* `CorreSpectra` (`corre_spectra.hpp`)
* `CorreSpectra_MT` (`corre_spectra_MT.hpp`)

and ReHMC Walk for sampling from log-concave distributions:

*
*

I added several functions in `include/sampling/sample_correlation_matrices.hpp` to facilitate the use of sampling correlation matrices in `volesti`. These functions are template function with template 

`template<typename WalkType, typename PointType, typename RNGType, typename PointList>`

where

* `WalkType`: type of the random walk in use, e.g., BallWalk, RDHRWalk, BilliardWalk
* `PointType`: type of points in use
* `RNGType`: type of random number generators
* `PointList`: type of lists of sample points, e.g., `std::vector<PointType>` or `std::list<PointType>`

These user functions are listed below, classified according to the sampling distribution:

**Uniform sampling** 
* `direct_uniform_sampling<...>(...)`: uniform sampling with the general `Spectrahedron` class (already in `volesti`) (used for comparison purposes)
* `uniform_correlation_sampling<...>(...)`: uniform sampling with the `CorreSpectra` class
* `uniform_correlation_sampling_MT<...>(...)`: uniform sampling with the `CorreSpectra_MT` class

**Exponential sampling**

**Gaussian sampling**

### **Examples**

Uniform sampling of `num_points` `n * n` correlation matrices 
`uniform_correlation_sampling<WalkType, Point, RNGType>(n, randPoints, walkL, num_points, 0)`

## II - More implementation details

The main operations for sampling correlation matrices are the oracles:

* `membership` tests whether the current point lies in the 
* `intersection` computes the intersection of $\bm{x} + t \cdot \bm{v}$ and the boundary of $K$
* `reflection` computes the direction of reflection

### CorreSpectra

This class inherits: The main instance variables of this class are

* `MT` : A correlation matrix $A = (a_{i,j})_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}$
* `VT` : A vector of independent coefficients of a correlation matrix
* `unsigned int d` :
* `unsigned int n` :

The membership oracle is changed to 

### CorreSpectra_MT

This class serves as the same but we want to experiment the idea of storing the whole matrix . We need to say that 

For this class, I needed to implement also a new method GetDirection (found in):

Based on the use of PointType template variables in random walk implementations of `volesti`, to handle MT PointType, I implemented a `CorreMatrix` class that operates as and its basic operators.

The old GetDirection method return a Vector Type (VT) . My new method returns a Matrix Type (MT). The way this method being implemented is .

### Geometric oracles

I added some functions in `include/matrix_operations/EigenvaluesProblems.h` to accelerate random walk algorithms:

* **Membership:** Testing $A \in K$ means testing whether $A$ is positive semidefinite. The old function in `volesti` computes the largest eigenvalue of $A$ with `Eigen::SelfAdjointEigenSolver` or `Spectra::SymEigsSolver`.<br><br> 
I changed this to `Eigen::LDLT` that computes `A`'s Cholesky decomposition when `A` is positive semidefinite or signals an error otherwise (see `isPositiveSemidefinite` function).

* **Intersection:** The intersection oracle needs to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem for symmetric matrices. This principle is not changed but by experiments, I found that `Eigen::GeneralizedSelfAdjointEigenSolver` is faster than the currently in-use `Spectra::SymGEigsSolver`.<br><br>
Hence, I added a function `minPosLinearEigenvalue_EigenSymSolver` which is used by the intersection oracles in `CorreSpectra` and `CorreSpectra_MT` classes.  

* **Reflection:** Each matrix $A_{i,j}$ in the linear matrix inequality of $K$ has only two non-zero entries $a_{i,j} = a_{j,i} = 1$. Substituting these matrices in the formula for the reflection direction we obtain: $$ a.$$
This new implementation is much faster than the naive one and helps improve the performance of random walks using reflection. 

### ReHMC Walk

## Testing

Testing in `volesti` is done in the `test/` folder which uses `doctest` (v. ) and `CMake` to generate tests.

I wrote ` test/sampling_correlation_matrices_test.cpp` including test functions and several `doctest`-format tests and added the aforementioned new tests in `test/CMakeLists.txt` for building. 

My tests assert whether
* the generated matrices are correlation matrices 
* the PRSF of the whole sample set is smaller than $1.1$.

I tested Ball Walk, RDHR Walk and Billiard Walk on `Spectrahedron`, `CorreSpectra` and `CorreSpectra_MT` for various matrix size $3 \leq n \leq 100$ and obtained:
* :heavy_check_mark: The matrices generated by random walk algorithms all satisfy to be correlation matrices
* The PRSF value varies following Walk Type, $n$ and the number of samples.


## Experiments with random walk algorithms

Note that 

First, I will explain in details the implementation changes in Ball Walk, RDHR Walk and Billiard Walk. These random walks already exist in `volesti` but the new operations in `CorreSpectra` and `CorreSpectra_MT` bring better performance.

### Ball Walk algorithm
Ball Walk is already implemented in `volesti`. To use this implementation to run with ampling correlation matrices, we needed to change . Ball Walk algorithm is done by 
*
*

Hence, the membership oracle `is_in` is used intensively. The old implementation of uses . My new `is_in` method uses . The table below illustrates the speed-up using this new `is_in` method.

### Billiard Walk algorithm

Billiard Walk mainly uses the `intersection` and `reflection` oracles. The new implementations of these oracles in `CorreSpectra` and `CorreSpectra_MT` accelerate Billiard Walk in `volesti` for sampling correlation matrices.

The main acceleration come from the new `reflection` which is specialized for correlation matrices. Since Billiard Walk is a random walk that uses intensively `reflection`, this results in an impressive performance illustrated in the table below.

### Doctest bug in `volesti`

While building `volesti`'s test on an Ubuntu 22.04 system, I encountered an error: . This comes from `doctest.h` v1.2.9 being used in `test/`. A proposed fix is to use `doctest.h` v2.4.8 found at [https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/v2.4.8/doctest/doctest.h](https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/v2.4.8/doctest/doctest.h).
